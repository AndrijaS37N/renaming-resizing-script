# renaming-resizing-script
### A simple Bash console app.

* Made for the <b>CS324 Scripting Languages</b> course. üçè
* Used and tested on Mac OS, I presume it works fine on Linux. This however was not checked.
* Liked tinkering a bit with Bash for this.

## Requirements
Needs the ImageMagick package for the <i>convert</i> command. I installed it with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```
brew install imagemagick
```

For Linux you could try using Linuxbrew or some other alternative to Homebrew.
