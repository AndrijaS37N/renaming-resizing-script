# Renaming Resizing Script
### A simple Bash console app.

* Used and tested on MacOS. I presume it works fine on Linux. However, this was not checked.
* I liked tinkering with Bash for this.
* Made in PyCharm with BashSupport.

## Requirements
Needs the [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) package for the <i>convert</i> command. I installed it with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```
brew install imagemagick
```

For Linux you could try using Linuxbrew or some other alternative to Homebrew.
